# VirtualResume2

Welcome to my virtual resume.

Feel free to download the code or visit mnickolay.github.io to view the project.

The point of this project was to exercise my coding, learn more, and show what I am capable of doing.

This is the second draft of this project; the first ended up moving in a direction that was simplistic or fluid in my opinion, so I start with a second project.

The site itself runs on one HTML page that has different sections that are updated with HTML via JS.

If you have an interest in what each page has to offer, in the application you can hover (or click on mobile) over the logo to get more information about how each page functions.

The next steps for this project is to make another version of it that can run off of React.

Thank you for visiting my vitrual resume :)

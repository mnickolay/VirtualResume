# VirtualResume2

Welcome to my virtual resume.

Feel free to download the code or visit mnickolay.github.io to view the project.

The point of this project was to exercise my coding, learn more, and show what I am capable of doing.

If you have an interest in what each page has to offer, in the application you can hover (or click on mobile) over the logo to get more information about how each page functions.

Thank you for visiting my vitrual resume :)

        <p class="aboutBodyPara">I am a coding bootcamp graduate looking to start my career in programming.</p>
        <p class="aboutBodyPara">I graduated college with a degree in HVAC/R, but didn't enjoy the industry. I soon found a passion in computers.</p>
        <p class="aboutBodyPara">I am very interested in coding and computers in generalâ€” the more I learn, the more I am blown away by what they are capable of.</p>
        <p class="aboutBodyPara">Though I don't know exactly where my visions in my programming career lie, I am excited to experiencing new things.</p>
        <p class="aboutBodyPara">Thank you for visiting. I appreciate you taking time to look at my virtual resume!</p>
